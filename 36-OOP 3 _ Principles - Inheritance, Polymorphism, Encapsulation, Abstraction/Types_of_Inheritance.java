/*
___________________________________________________________________________________
1- Single Inheritance
----> One class extends another

___________________________________________________________________________________
2- MultiLevel Inheritance
----> If One class extends another class and that another class further extends other class... This is multilevel inheritance

___________________________________________________________________________________
3- Multiple Inheritance
----> If a class is derived from two or more parent classes then that is multiple inheritance... 

----> Java does not support it... Because if lets say there are two classes "A" and "B" and there is another class "C" that is derived from A and B... Then if "A" class has a variable named "n=10" and "B" class has variable named "n=5" and class "C" tries to print "n" then what will it print?? 
----> This is a problem why java doesn't support multiple inheritance

___________________________________________________________________________________
4- Hierarchial Inheritance
----> One class is inherited by many classes

So like a class "A" is a parent class... classes like "B", "C" and "D" are derived from this "A" class

___________________________________________________________________________________
5- Hybrid Inheritance
----> It is a mixture of single and multiple inheritance... But since in java the multiple inheriatnce is not allowed so hybrid is not allowed either

So its like There is a class "A" from which two classes "B" and "C" are derived and then there is a Class "D" which is derived from that "B" and "C"
