----> In java there are so many data structures that share some common methods or fetures like add() get() remove() and all... So java members decided to make a collection of these methods and stuff and place it in an interface called "Collection" and now the data structures that uses these basically implements from the "Collection" interface and the internal impleentation of these depends on the type of data structure... Obviously, this is made an abstraction from the user so we don't really care about the implementation... Java Collection Framework picture is in this folder

----> Enums are basically public, static and final constants type that are fixed and that cannot be changed or reinstantiated... So basically they are used when we know that only these much variables can exist in the environment... For Example we know that the week days cannot exceed seven... So we create an enum of Week and list all the seven days inside...
