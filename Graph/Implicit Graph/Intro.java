----> In implicit graph there is a 2D array... In the qustions somehow similar to like you are at the graph[i][j] and you want to go to the (n-1)(m-1) lets say place... Then you can visulise the 2D array as a graph... Now in implicit graph, every vertex has 4 options to move... Except the corner vertices, every vertex has four neighbors... One up(i-1,j), One Down(i+1, j), One left (i,j-1) and One right (i, j+1)...

----> The Flood fill algorithm uses this representation of the graph...
