----> Wrapping up the implementation of the data members and methods in a class is known as Encapsulation...
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
----> Encapsulation handles the problems of implementation level while the Abstraction handles the issues of Design level
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
----> The difference between encapsulation and the abstraction is, that the encapsulation do its own work, it makes the methods and data types and all but wraps it so the internal implementation of something is achieved in the encapsulation phase, that how the thing actually works internally... 
----> On the other hand, Abstraction says that encapsulation has done its work, now I will provide some names of the methods and data members that you can use to use the code written inside the encapsulation...
