/*
 * Highest Common Factor Or Greatest Common Divisor---------->
 * -------------------------------> The minimum of the equation (ax + by) where
 * x and y are positive integers
 * 
 * HCF of two numbers (4, 10)
 * The factors of 4 are ---------------> 1,2,4
 * The factors of 10 are ---------------> 1,2,5,10
 * 
 * The greatest common of these factors is 2 which is the HCF or GCD of these
 * two numbers
 * 
 * 
 * _________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 * This can also be achieved by min(4x + 9y) where x and y are any the positive
 * integers
 * 
 * _________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 * To check if the equation is possible or not you can do like lets say take the
 * following example
 * 
 * You have a "Die Hard Problem" which states that you have two buckets, one if
 * of 3 litres and the second one is of 5 litres and you have to create a bucket
 * of 4 litre
 * 
 * Now one thing to notice is that you cannot do like 2.5litre or 3.2litre like
 * that... The values should be like 1,2,3,4 and stuff
 * 
 * Now the equation checking that it is possible or not is in the following
 * -----------> (3x + 5y) = 4
 * -----------> The common I can have over here is 1 on the L.H.S and 4/1 is not
 * a decimal value so yeah its possible
 * -----------> If the HCF is 1 then you can create any number of litres of
 * bucket....
 * 
 * Lets take another example
 * -----------> (2x + 4y) = 17
 * -----------> 2(x + 2y) = 17
 * -----------> x + 2y = 8.5
 * So as it is giving me decimal value so this conversion is not possible
