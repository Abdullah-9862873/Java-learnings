// You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

// Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

// Input: letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"
// Output: "c"
// Explanation: The smallest character that is lexicographically greater than 'a' in letters is 'c'.
